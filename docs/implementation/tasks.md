# Core Major Specs
- Merge Comprehensive Learner Record (CLR), Learning Record Store (LRS), and Solid Pods into a unified system.
- Ensure learner ownership of data through Solid Pods.
- Use xAPI for detailed learning activity tracking.
- Generate CLR from aggregated xAPI data stored in Solid Pods.
- Ensure interoperability using open standards like xAPI, RDF, and IMS CLR.

# Plan to Merge with Minor Specs

## Conceptual Architecture
- **Decentralized Personal Data Store (Smart Contract + IPFS)**:
  - Each learner's personal data, including learning records, will be stored decentralizadly using IPFS for data content and a Solana smart contract for identity, metadata, and fine-grained access control.
  - This architecture ensures full learner ownership and control over their data, allowing them to explicitly manage access permissions via the smart contract.
- **LRS for Activity Tracking**:
  - Learning activity data (e.g., xAPI statements) is generated by various platforms and stored in the learner's Solid Pod.
  - The LRS ensures detailed tracking and analytics of learning activities.
- **CLR for Holistic Representation**:
  - Aggregates and summarizes xAPI data stored in Solid Pods to generate a CLR.
  - CLR includes formal achievements, informal learning, and co-curricular activities.
- **Interoperability**:
  - Open standards like xAPI, RDF, and IMS CLR ensure seamless data flow between systems.
  - Applications can access CLR or raw xAPI data from the Pod with the learner's permission.

## 1. Backend Setup - Decentralized Personal Data Store & LRS on Blockchain
- Use a **Solana Smart Contract** and **IPFS** for managing decentralized personal data stores and the LRS functionalities.
- Configure the backend to:
  - Manage learning content for the LMS.
  - Record xAPI statements by storing them on IPFS and registering their CIDs and metadata, along with access control rules, on the Solana smart contract.
  - Retrieve xAPI statements and CLR data by querying the Solana smart contract for IPFS CIDs and then fetching the data from IPFS, strictly adhering to on-chain access permissions.
- Implement APIs to:
  - Store xAPI statements on the decentralized data store (IPFS + Smart Contract).
  - Retrieve CLR data from aggregated xAPI statements stored in the decentralized data store.
- Provide a step-by-step guide for setting up the decentralized backend for local development and testing, including:
  - Installation of Solana and Anchor development environment.
  - Configuration and deployment of Solana smart contracts.
  - Integration with IPFS (e.g., local IPFS node, Pinata for pinning).
  - Development of client-side logic for interacting with Solana smart contracts and IPFS.
